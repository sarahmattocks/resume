### _WORK_ {#experience}

Web-Developer
: *Freelancer*
  __January 2014-Present__
  Full-stack JavaScript development with technologies such as Node.js and Ember.js. While keeping up on XHTML/HTML5 and CSS3 best practices, I like to use frameworks such as Bootstrap and SASS to speed up development time. I build web apps that impact and empower the people using them. I have a genuine passion for writing highly-scalable, modular, and well-documented code; deploying responsive ‘mobile first’ HTML/CSS; and making pixel perfect user-friendly websites.
  
Riverstone Residential
: *Assistant Manager*
  __October 2010-May 2014__
  I worked extensively throughout Portand's luxury high rise luxury apartment/condo buildings. I was promoted into the Assistant Property Manager position following my brief initial success as a Leasing Consultant, I established a reputation for constantly meeting and exceeding goals for 'Net Operating Income'(NOI). Responsible for community operations, accounts receivable/payable, month-end financial reporting, all leasing and renewal activities, marketing, tenant relations, collections, and resident functions.
  
Insurance Agent
: *Indepentent Sales*
  __February 2007–October 2010__
  As an independent insurance agent, I worked closely with my clients to find the best match of benefits considering the strongest insurance companies and the needs of each individual. Being an independent agent, I had the freedom to work 'outside the box' to find coverage for my clients on an individual basis because there is no such thing as 'one plan is best for everyone'. I was determined to go beyond my own knowledge base and tap into the skills of the sales experts. Life insurance has multiple dimensions from which I learned many sophisticated concepts and how to implement them to meet consumer demand.
